# Shoppy Cart

behold! another half-finished ugly-ass coding challenge from a company I won't name but that you can probably figure out with detective work!

## prompt

make a storefront/shopping cart with a bunch of requirements that I won't bother to list

## how to run it

you'll need npm installed! then:

```javascript
// install dependencies
npm install
// start the server, then navigate to localhost:3000 in you browser
npm start
// run the tests
npm test
```

## todo

- make it not look bad, maybe with some Material Design kinda stuff
- improve modal animations, interactions, accessibility
- refactor to use consistent patterns and maybe MVC architecture
- refactor to use ES6 (maybe with a build step)
- UI testing
- maybe use localStorage to persist cart for the hell of it
